Much of this is common to any data science workflow, but due to the nature of the geochemical data itself, a few of these processes are still current research problems. Our research aims not to introduce radical change in methodology, but instead to simply streamline and standardise the process, such that we can use geochemistry in a robust way to address geological problems."
